## Data Quality Issues - Heat Scores Coverage

### Problem
Currently only **6 out of 55 wave events** have heat-level scoring data in the database. The EVENT_STATS_VIEW only shows 4 events with complete data (where heat scores + heat progression both exist and match).

**Current Coverage:**
- Total wave events in database: 55
- Events with HEAT_SCORES data: 6
- Events with HEAT_PROGRESSION data: 6
- Events in EVENT_STATS_VIEW: 4 (those with matching data)
- **Missing: 51 events need heat scoring data**

### Root Cause Analysis Needed

1. **Check PWA_IWT_HEAT_SCORES table:**
   - Only 1,901 records total
   - Why are only 6 events scraped?
   - Are the other events missing from source, or scraper issue?

2. **Check PWA_IWT_HEAT_PROGRESSION table:**
   - 219 heat structures total
   - Only 6 events have progression data
   - Need to verify if other events have this data available

3. **Data matching issues:**
   - Some events have scores but not progression (or vice versa)
   - Need to investigate why 2 events have data but don't show in view

### Tasks

#### 1. Investigate Missing Heat Data
- [ ] Run PWA heat scraper for all 55 wave events
- [ ] Check if PWA website has heat data for older events (2016-2024)
- [ ] Document which events don't have heat data available at source

#### 2. Fix Heat Scores Data Collection
- [ ] Review `src/scrapers/pwa_heat_scraper.py`
- [ ] Check if scraper is limited to recent events only
- [ ] Update scraper to collect all available heat data
- [ ] Re-run scraper for missing events

#### 3. Fix Heat Progression Data Collection
- [ ] Review heat progression scraping logic
- [ ] Ensure all events with heats also have progression data
- [ ] Verify division matching between HEAT_SCORES and HEAT_PROGRESSION

#### 4. Data Quality Verification
- [ ] After re-scraping, verify EVENT_STATS_VIEW coverage
- [ ] Goal: All events with heat data should appear in view
- [ ] Ensure sex column is populated for all records

### Expected Outcome
- All events with available heat data scraped and loaded
- EVENT_STATS_VIEW shows all events with complete heat scoring
- Event Stats API endpoint works for maximum number of events

## Event Stats API - Status: ✅ WORKING

The Event Stats API endpoint has been **successfully implemented** and is working correctly for events with complete data.

### Completed
- ✅ Created EVENT_STATS_VIEW database view
- ✅ Implemented `GET /api/v1/events/{event_id}/stats` endpoint
- ✅ Added Pydantic models for response structure
- ✅ Fixed sex column population via JOIN to HEAT_PROGRESSION
- ✅ Tested with event ID 14 (Tenerife Grand Slam)
- ✅ Feature branch: `feature/event-stats-api`

### API Endpoint Details
**URL:** `GET /api/v1/events/{event_id}/stats?sex=Women|Men`

**Returns:**
- Summary stats (best heat, jump, wave scores)
- Move type statistics with averages
- Complete lists of all heat/jump/wave scores
- Metadata (total heats, athletes, timestamp)

**Performance:**
- Uses database view (EVENT_STATS_VIEW) for efficiency
- Pre-aggregated statistics
- Reduced from 9 queries to 7 queries

### Next Steps
1. Fix data coverage (see tasks above)
2. Test with more events once data is complete
3. Merge feature branch to main when data is ready

---

## Notes
- Current working events: IDs 14, 16, 27, 39 (and 2 others)
- Feature branch created and code committed
- API is production-ready, just needs more source data
